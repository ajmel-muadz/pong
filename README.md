Hello! This is a work in progress for my Pong video game. This is my first ever major side-project that is not school-related. It is also the first project I am working on that is not a terminal program.

This is the classic video game 'Pong' made in Python using Pygame. This Pong game features unique ball angles when hitting the paddles.

Keep an eye out for the finished product :) (I will update this terrible README soon!)
